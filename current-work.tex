\textcolor{blue}{This chapter of the research proposal gives a concise outline of the work you have 
carried out so far and of the progress you have made toward the aims of the project. You 
should concentrate on the parts that contribute specifically to the goals of the proposal, 
avoiding detailed descriptions of digressions you may have attempted in the earlier, 
more exploratory, phases of your work. If you have already obtained preliminary 
results, this is the chapter where you should provide them, in a structured manner that 
helps supporting the rest of the proposal.}
