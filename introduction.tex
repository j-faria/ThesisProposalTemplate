This part provides an overall introduction of your work, including
related work of your proposal.
The introduction gives an overview of the research project you propose to carry out. It 
explains the background of the project, focusing briefly on the major issues of its 
knowledge domain and clarifying why these issues are worthy of attention. It then 
proceeds with the concise presentation of the research statement, which can take the 
form of a hypothesis, a research question, a project statement, or a goal statement. The 
research statement should capture both the essence of the project and its delimiting 
boundaries, and should be followed by a clarification of the extent to which you expect 
its outcomes to represent an advance in the knowledge domain you have described. 
The introduction should endeavor, from the very beginning, to catch the reader's 
interest and should be written in a style that can be understood easily by any reader with 
a general science background. It should cite all relevant references pertaining to the 
major issues described, and it should close with a brief description of each one of the 
chapters that follow. 
Many authors prefer to postpone writing the Introduction till the rest of the document is 
finished. This makes a lot of sense, since the act of writing tends to introduces many 
changes in the plans initially sketched by the writer, so that it is only by the time the 
whole document is finished that the writer gets a clear view of how to construct an 
introduction that is, indeed, compelling. }
